            <p>Hi There,</p>
            <p>Google Maps is a map service provided by Google that supports a wide variety of configuration settings. 
                Adding Google Maps to your application can provide users with more contextual information than a street address or set of coordinates.
            </p>
            <p>This tutorial shows you how to add a Map and Marker to a React application using 
                google-map-react and integrate the map and markers into the application state.
            </p> 
        </div>
